      <p>Hi, I’m Khalis. I’m an applications consultant with over 6 years of experience in technology, specialising in Data.</p>

<p>I like exploring new things in technology and understanding how it works, so that I can provide and design applications and architectures that will best fit the 
requirements for users, and to future-proof products for growth in the long run.
I’ve experienced various web development languages and frameworks, data products and cloud technologies such as:

</p><p>Reduction in gatherings and social events, and the increase in remote meetings and work has impacted us, both positively and negatively. 
The reduced socialising and physical meetings may have affected the way how we’re able to read body languages and actions during conversations.
Using OpenCV and Tensorflow, and testing with different pre-trained models with transfer learning (such as VGG16, Resnet50, etc), I’ve developed 
a model that achieves a 77% accuracy in detecting facial emotions based on the classes: ‘anger’, ‘contempt’, ‘disgust’, ‘fear’, ‘happiness’, ‘neutral’, 
‘sadness’ and ‘surprise’.</p>

<p>This project also demonstrates some simple use in applications, using screen capture to mimic facial detection on video calls, and hosting a server for use
on a web browser.</p>

Breaker period, I was involved in setting up the call centre for SMEs and businesses within a short timeframe. Separately, I developed 
a single page web application for businesses intending to apply for SG Clean Certification, using cloud services in AWS within 5 days.</p>

<p>As part of my role in the data analytics practice group, I spearheaded initiatives on data visualisation for business users to be more data-
driven, picking up tools like Tableau to build their own customised dashboards to look at their data.</p>
